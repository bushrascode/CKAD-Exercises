1)Build a Docker image using the Dockerfile below and tag it as my-username/alpine
FROM alpine:latest 
CMD ["sh", "-c", "echo 'Container is running...'; sleep 3600"]

- docker build -t bushra-fatima/alpine 

2)List all docker images

- docker images 
can also use docker image list

3)Create a container using the my-username/alpine image, run it in the background, and name it my-container

- docker run -d --name=bushra-container bushra-fatima/alpine

4)Show all running containers

- docker ps

5)Write the logs of the container to logs.txt

- docker logs <container_id> > logs.txt

6)Stop the container

- docker stop <container_id>

7)List all containers. Do you see the stopped one?

- docker ps -a

8)Export the container to a TAR archive

- docker export <container_id> > bushra-container.tar

9)Delete the container

- docker rm <first 2 char of container id>

10)Save the image as a TAR file

- docker save <image_id> > <file_name>.tar

11)Delete the image

- docker rmi <image_id>

12)Load the deleted image from the archive file and retag it as my-username/alpine:v1

- docker load < <image-filename>.tar
- docker tag <image-sha> bushra-fatima/alpine:v1
- docker images (to check it is done correctly)






* notes:

ðŸ‘‰ What does > mean in Linux?

Itâ€™s an output redirection operator.

Instead of sending command output to the terminal (stdout), it sends it into a file.

Example:

ls > files.txt


This puts the output of ls into a file called files.txt.

If the file already exists, it gets overwritten.

If you want to append instead of overwrite, you use >>.

ðŸ—‚ What is tar?

tar = tape archive (throwback to when backups went onto magnetic tape).

Itâ€™s a command-line utility in Linux/Unix used to bundle multiple files together into a single archive file.

Think of it as Linuxâ€™s version of making a .zip, but without compression by default.

Common uses in Docker/K8s world:

Packaging source code into one .tar file for transfer/build.

Saving/exporting Docker images as .tar files (docker save myimage > myimage.tar).

Loading images later from that archive (docker load < myimage.tar).
